   abstract = {This work presents a new modelling approach to the elaboration of a simple model of surface fire spread. This model runs faster than real-time and will be integrated in management tools. Until now, models used in such tools have been based on an empirical relationship. These tools may be efficient for conditions that are comparable to those of test-fires but the absence of a physical description makes them inapplicable to other situations. This paper proposes a physical 3D model of surface fire able to predict fire behaviour faster than real-time. This model is tested on experiments carried out across fuel beds under slope and wind conditions.},

@article{Anderson2010,
   abstract = {An extensive set of wind-tunnel fires was burned to investigate convective heat transfer ahead of a steadily progressing fire front moving across a porous fuel bed. The effects of fuel and environmental variables on the gas temperature profile and the 'surface wind speed' (gas velocity at the fuel bed surface) are reported. In non-zero winds, the temperature of the air near the fuel bed surface decays exponentially with distance from the fire front. In zero winds, the temperature decreases rapidly within a very short distance of the flame front, then decays slowly thereafter. The maximum air temperature decreases as the free stream wind speed, packing ratio and fuel moisture content increase. The characteristic distance of the exponential decay increases strongly with the free stream wind speed and decreases with the packing ratio and surface area-to-volume ratio of the fuel. The surface wind speed depends strongly on the free stream wind speed, and to a lesser extent on packing ratio, fuel bed depth and fuel moisture content. There are three general regimes for the surface flow: (1) a constant velocity flow of approximately half the free stream flow, far from the flame front; (2) an intermediate zone of minimum flow characterised by low or reversed flow; and (3) a region near the flame front where the velocity rises rapidly almost to the free stream velocity. The boundaries between the three regions move further from the flame front with increasing wind speed, in a way which is only slightly affected by fuel geometry. © 2010 IAWF.},

   abstract = {The Rothermel surface fire spread model, with some adjustments by Frank A. Albini in 1976, has been used in fire and fuels management systems since 1972. It is generally used with other models including fireline intensity and flame length. Fuel models are often used to define fuel input parameters. Dynamic fuel models use equations for live fuel curing. Models have been developed for the effect of cross-slope wind and for fire spread in directions other than head fire. Equations for the Rothermel model and associated models are presented for easy reference. The influence of input variables on results is examined. While the spread model is used in the U.S. National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS), there are significant differences. The NFDRS equations and fuel models are given. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for those interested in the foundation of wildland fire modeling. System developers will benefit from equations from various sources being in one document. Developers of custom fuel models will find information on the impact of fuel parameters on rate of spread calculations.},

@article{Balbi2020,
   abstract = {The 'Balbi model' is a simplified steady-state physical propagation model for surface fires that considers radiative heat transfer from the surface area of burning fuel particles as well as from the flame body. In this work, a completely new version of this propagation model for wildand fires is proposed. Even if, in the present work, this model is confined to laboratory experiments, its purpose is to be used at a larger scale in the field under operational conditions. This model was constructed from a radiative propagation model with the addition of a convective heat transfer term resulting from the impingement of packets of hot reacting gases on unburnt fuel elements located at the base of the flame. The flame inside the fuel bed is seen as the 'fingers of fire' described in the literature. The proposed model is physics-based, faster than real time and fully predictive, which means that model parameters do not change from one experiment to another. The predicted rate of spread is applied to a large set of laboratory experiments (through homogeneous pine needles and excelsior fuel beds) and is compared with the predictions of both a very simple empirical model (Catchpole) and a detailed physical model (FireStar2D).},

   abstract = {The 'Balbi model' is a simplified rate of fire spread model aimed at providing computationally fast and accurate simulations of fire propagation that can be used by fire managers under operational conditions. This model describes the steady-state spread rate of surface fires by accounting for both radiation and convection heat transfer processes. In the present work the original Balbi model developed for laboratory conditions is improved by addressing specificities of outdoor fires, such as fuel complexes with a mix of live and dead materials, a larger scale and an open environment. The model is calibrated against a small training dataset (n = 25) of shrubland fires conducted in Turkey. A sensitivity analysis of model output is presented and its predictive capacity against a larger independent dataset of experimental fires in shrubland fuels from different regions of the world (Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) is tested. A comparison with older versions of the model and a generic empirical model is also conducted with encouraging results. The improved model remains physics-based, faster than real time and fully predictive.},
